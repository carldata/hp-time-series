# React Redux Bootstrap Typescript D3 Starter Kit

This work is greatly influenced by the following: 
- https://github.com/jaysoo/todomvc-redux-react-typescript
- https://github.com/freddyrangel/playing-with-react-and-d3

This is a fairly simple starter kit with the following libraries / "technologies" intermingled and playing well with each other:
* Webpack with Developmnet Server extension and "hot-reloading"
* Redux
* ReactJS
* React Bootstrap https://react-bootstrap.github.io/
* D3 adapted for React
* Redux DevTools Extension https://github.com/zalmoxisus/redux-devtools-extension

## Running the server

Requirements:
- NodeJS 4+

```
npm install
npm run start:dev
```
Visit [http://localhost:8000/](http://localhost:8000/) in your browser.

## Additional notes

Hot reloading works with React, but there is a problem with Redux, so it is best to use key-stroked reloading by pressing ctrl+r in Chrome
